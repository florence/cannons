Turn order: big1(then move exactly 3) big2(then move exactly 3) small1 small2

big: turret: move up to 90 or shoot, nothing
     middle segment: rotate 45 around middle or change velocity, or nothing
     for big shit, acceleration adds two vectors, normalizes

small: pick 2 exclusive (move up 3, turn up to 45, shoot, nothing)

Every segment has 3 health, loose 1, loose entire ship

collisions = 1 damage

destroy: keep movement, ship dead but stay on field

turn order on destroy: skip



ideas: next round remove exclusive on fighter
       next round guns shoot while moving
