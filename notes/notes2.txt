Turn order: small1 small2 big1(then move exactly 3) big2(then move exactly 3)

big: turret: move up to 90 or shoot, nothing
     middle segment: rotate 45 around middle or change velocity, or nothing
     for big shit, acceleration adds two vectors, normalizes

     big turn order:
       determine what movement and gun orders

       do movement (turn, then handle momentum)
       if gun as fire order, it fires if it can at any point(while active, i.e. not while ships go)
       then turn guns

small: Any 2 movement, or 1 movement and 1 attack. (move up 3, turn up to 45, shoot, nothing)

Every segment has 3 health, loose 1, loose entire ship

collisions betwen fighter and any are "passed through" no damage

collisions = 1 damage for capitals, loss of momentum if its towars the collision


destroy: keep movement, ship dead but stay on field

turn order on destroy: skip

collision w/ debree always destroys it, take 1 damage


for next time: change how turn order changes on destroyed ship
               maybe every ship declared, then every ship moves
