Turn order: small1 small2 big1(then move exactly 3) big2(then move exactly 3)

changes to health: 3 front, 4 middle, 4 back. loosing front just looses guns.
                   loosing front costs momentum and acceleration

big: turret: move up to 90 or shoot, nothing
     middle segment: rotate 45 around middle or change velocity, or nothing
     for big shit, acceleration adds two vectors, normalizes

     big turn order:
       determine what movement and gun orders

       do movement (turn, then handle momentum)
       if gun as fire order, it fires if it can at any point(while active, i.e. not while ships go)
       then turn guns

small: Any 2 movement, or 1 movement and 1 attack. (move up 3, turn up to 45, shoot, nothing)

Every segment has 3 health, loose 1, loose entire ship

collisions betwen fighter and any are "passed through" no damage

collisions = 1 damage for capitals, loss of momentum if its towars the collision


destroy: keep movement, ship dead but stay on field

turn order on destroy: skip

collision w/ debree always destroys it, take 1 damage



next time:
   shooting range needs to be longer than movement range. Maybeships have longer range when not in motion.
   rethink frigets moving through capital ships


maybe later:
change how turn order changes on destroyed ship

problem: frigitates can't circle strafe.

2 frigates, less health

when we can test: maybe every ship declared, then every ship moves
